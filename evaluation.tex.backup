\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

The aim of this section is to highlight the attack's impact on both the DONet network as well as when SWAP is also functioning. To that end, first I introduce the main parameters used for the simulation and then discuss the results.

\subsection{Simulation parameters}
First, the main simulation parameters are provided in Table \ref{tab:SM-Parameters}. Note that two runs were executed for each simulation configuration. 
For describing the results, I used only one results out of the two runs as they showed almost typical behavior.

\subsection{Case studies}
For every simulation configuration, the results for both networks (DONet w/o SWAP) are provided. 
The metric used in comparing all the results is \emph{Instant Loss (IL)}: the ratio of missed chunks to the total number of chunks emitted from the source.

The attack's impact are discussed through the following two case studies:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \emph{Impact of $Hx$} through varying $Hx={2,5,8,10}$ while fixing $MN=5$ and $hops=1$.
 \item \emph{Impact of $MN$} through varying $MN={1,3,5}$ while fixing $Hx=8$ and $hops=1$.
 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Results}

The results along with a discussion for each of the two aforementioned case studies are detailed next.

\subsubsection{Impact of $Hx$}
Given that the maximum number of neighbors that the source or any other peer can have is $\alpha =10$, it's interesting to see the impact of occupying a certain fraction of the source's neighbor list.
Figure~\ref{fig:DONet} and Figure~\ref{fig:swap} depicts the impact of increasing the fraction of malicious headnodes while keeping the number of malicious neighbors to those malicious headnodes constant.

For DONet, as long as the source's neighbor list size $\alpha$ is not fully saturated with malicious peers, benign peers $b$ eventually get a stable flow of the video chunks, as depicted in Figure~\ref{subfig:Donet-hx2} through Figure~\ref{subfig:Donet-hx8}.
Nevertheless, due to the time constraints of such overlay, the fraction of lost chunks is remarkably high once the source starts to generate chunks. 
The average $IL$ averages between 49\%-80\% at times 50s-150s. 
This denotes that once the source starts sending video chunks, benign peers are almost not able to receive those chunks for an intolerant period of time, which is commonly unacceptable for P2P streaming applications' users.

Figure~\ref{subfig:Donet-hx10} shows the impact of fully injecting the source's neighbor list neighbors by malicious peers, where in this case $\alpha = x$.
In this case, the average $IL$ is almost 100\%, which denotes benign peers being totally unable to receive video chunks as malicious peers fully acquire all chunks from the source.

For SWAP, which is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:swap}, the attack's impact is even worse compared to DONet.
This is due to that malicious headnodes $x$ constantly nominates malicious neighbors $MN$ to the source. Eventually, the source acquires $\alpha$ malicious peers in its neighbor list, which in turn causes the $IL$ to reach to ~100\%.
Moreover, higher values of $x$ results in earlier total block of video chunks as shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:swap-hx2} through Figure~\ref{subfig:swap-hx10}.
Next, the impact of having different values of $MN$ is discussed.

\subsubsection{Impact of $MN$}

In this case study, $x=8$ is selected instead of $x=10$ to avoid hindering the impact of varying $MN$ when the source's neighbor list is already saturated with malicious peers, i.e., when $\alpha=x=10$.
Figure~\ref{subfig:swap-MN1} through Figure~\ref{subfig:swap-MN5} show that for $MN=1$, $IL$ reaches ~100\% at time $t=250s$. 
For $MN=5$, $IL$ is already at 80\% at $t=50s$.

As expected, when $MN$ increases, the source's neighbor list gets saturated with malicious peers earlier as the number of nominated malicious peers increase.
Note that the source does not accept a connection with a peer who was already connected to it.

Moreover, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:Attack}, malicious peers can drop or manipulate the number of hops in the nomination requests from benign peers.
Thus, assessing the attack's impact over different number of hops would yield the same results.

\subsubsection{Summary of the results}

As a summary, for DONet, when the source's neighbor list is fully saturated with malicious peers, $IL$ is at ~100\%.
Nevertheless, for smaller values of $x$, the attack's impact is still significantly high for a long period of time given the intolerability of such networks to such high delays.

For the SWAP case study, it is noticed that even with low values of $x$, after a certain swapping period, malicious peers manage to fully occupy the source's list and thus, $IL$ eventually reaches to ~100\%.
This denotes that, the number of neighbors $MN$ is very critical specially in the case of SWAP.
